# Beer Dispenser
_demo of beer-dispenser scene running in preview._

![demo](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/beer-dispenser/blob/main/screenshots/beer-dispenser.gif)

## Description
A beer dispenser that uses P2P messaging so that you can pour beer for yourself and friends. To view the scene, please visit [here](https://beer-dispenser.vercel.app/).

## Instructions
Pick up and put down the beer glass using the <kbd>E</kbd> key - you will only be able to place the beer glass on a flat surface that's pointing upwards. To fill a glass, place it at one of the bases on the dispenser and then press on the corresponding tap using the the <kbd>E</kbd> key again; to drink the beer just press the <kbd>F</kbd> key. Use your mouse to look around and <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> keys on your keyboard to move forward, left, backward and right respectively. Finally, pressing the <kbd>Space</kbd> key will make your avatar jump.

If you launch a scene preview and open it in two (or more) browser windows, each window will be interpreted as a separate player and a mock communications server will keep these players in sync.

_Note: If you open separate tabs in the same window, the interaction wonâ€™t work properly, as only one tab will be treated as active by the browser at a time._
